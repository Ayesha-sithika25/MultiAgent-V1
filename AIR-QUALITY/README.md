# Project : 'AQ-UI-with-Mail' and 'Air-Quality-Notifier'

This projects are Python script (Python version : 3.13.6) that runs in the background, fetching PM2.5 levels for a city and provides alerts. It shows results in the terminal, displays notifications, and sends email at regular intervals. Then they are integrated to a full interactive web application using Streamlit. 

## Sample Output

> üü¢ Air Quality Report
> 
> PM2.5: 65 ¬µg/m¬≥ in city Delhi
> 
> Suggestion: Moderate air quality. Safe but sensitive people should wear a mask.

> üìß Email sent successfully.
> 
> ‚è∞ Waiting 300 seconds...
